DESCRIPTION:Do you want learn about Galaxy and big data analysis or get some updates about the European Galaxy server and our community?\n\nCome and join our talk about Galaxy in Freiburg!\n\n<h2 id="when">When?</h2>10th September 2019 from 12-13:00\n\n<h2 id="where">Where?</h2>Room SR 00.023, Signalhaus Freiburg, Schänzlestr. 18, 79104 Freiburg\n\n<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2><strong>The European Galaxy server: A platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborativebig data analyses</strong>\n\nAnalysis of large biomedical datasets produced by high-throughput data generationtechnologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well assubstantial computational power. Researchers want to be involved in their computation-dependent data analyses but therefore they need a suitable computational infrastructure andin-depth bioinformatics training. The Galaxy project tries to solve this by providing a frameworkfor accessible, reproducible and collaborative data analysis to ensure the researcherparticipation on their own data analysis. Galaxy is an open-source web-based scientific dataanalysis platform used nowadays by hundreds of thousands of scientists across the world toanalyze large biomedical datasets such as those found in e.g. epigenetics, genomics,transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, multi-omics analysis, imaging, and many more.Our team is providing high-quality hands-on training material on data analysis with Galaxy,and we give training courses and workshops for Galaxy users and admins everywhere in theworld.\n\nMore information:Galaxy Europe https://galaxyproject.eu\n\n
