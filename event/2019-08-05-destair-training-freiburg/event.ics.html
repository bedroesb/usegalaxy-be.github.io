DESCRIPTION:In this training course, we introduce the Galaxy framework (https://usegalaxy.eu) for biomedical data analyses, and showcase its tools for data handling and preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, bisulfite sequencing analysis, and Oxford Nanopore data exploration and usage. Lectures will be provided on the topics of RNA and Bisulfite sequencing, Epigenetics, and basic statistics, and followed by hands-on sessions. Finally, we showcase a Galaxy Docker installation for customized workflow analysis.\n\n<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>Lectures and hands-on sessions will focus on the following topics:\n\n<ul>  <li>Next Generation Sequencing</li>  <li>Epigenetics</li>  <li>Workflow development</li>  <li>Differential gene expression analysis</li>  <li>Differential methylation analysis</li>  <li>Oxford Nanopore data processing</li></ul><h2 id="learning-goals">Learning goals</h2><ul>  <li>Know your data, and the implications of data preprocessing and quality control</li>  <li>Performing differential gene expression analysis using Galaxy</li>  <li>Performing differential methylation analysis using Galaxy</li>  <li>Handling and analyze Oxford Nanopore sequencing data</li></ul><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>This workshop is intended for MSc/PhD students, postdocs, and researchers with a background in Life Science research.
