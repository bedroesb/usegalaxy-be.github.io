DESCRIPTION:The Freiburg Galaxy team will organize a local Galaxy User Conferencefrom 15th to 16th of March 2018, and we would like to inviteyou all.\n\nThe idea is to gather interesting talks from our community about theirapplications and use cases of Galaxy, and learn from each other. We haveinvited special guests from important Galaxy hotspots from all overEurope and the US, and got already several confirmations  - so thismight become an international conference :).Furthermore, we want to celebrate that the Freiburg Galaxy serverbecomes the new usegalaxy.eu server - which is amazing for us!\n\nAs you see: Many new things are going on! So come to our Galaxy UserConference, get to know in person the Freiburg Galaxy Team, members ofELIXIR and de.NBI, and of course more Galaxy users.\n\nWe have reserved the lecture hall in the Otto-Krayer-Haus (inFreiburg/Germany). The conference will be free of any charge, and wehave some limited travel budget if this is a problem for someone.However, we provide snacks and drinks and it would be fantastic if youcould cancel your registration 2 weeks before if you cannot attend.\n\nFor a better planning on our side, please register for attendance of theconference and let us know if you like to talk about your research:\n\n<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/El8re81AqbsTvguj2">https://goo.gl/forms/El8re81AqbsTvguj2</a>\n\nThe program will be send around middle of February.Bjoern, on behalf of the Freiburg Galaxy Team\n\n
