DESCRIPTION:<strong>Intended Audience</strong>\n\nBiologists and other life science researchers who would like to use Galaxy for NGS analysis.\n\nNo prior bioinformatics or programming knowledge is required.\n\n<strong>Learning Outcomes</strong>\n\nThis training aims to familiarise you with the Galaxy user interface. As an example, we will perform a basic NGS workflow in Galaxy (RNA-Seq or DNA-Seq), where you will learn how to import data, run tools, work with histories, and create workflows.\n\nThis tutorial will use the European Galaxy instance https://usegalaxy.eu/ and you need to create a free account.\n\n<strong>More information</strong>\n\nThere will be desktop computers available, but if you like you can bring your own laptop.\n\nThis workshop is organised by ELIXIR Belgium, and it is provided for free.\n\nMore information and registration: <a href="http://www.vib.be/en/training/research-training/courses/Pages/NGS-Introduction-using-Galaxy.aspx">course webpage</a>\n\n
