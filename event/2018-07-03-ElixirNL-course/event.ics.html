DESCRIPTION:Analysing molecular data in translational medicine involves a multitude of computational steps. Here, we introduce the basics of how to design and run these steps within Galaxy, a free and easy-to-use web platform that enables users to connect bioinformatics tools into a workflow without any prior programming expertise.\n\nThis course consists of two parts. Part 1 will let you get familiar with Galaxy; it will introduce some bioinformatics workflows used for RNAseq, variant detection and metagenomics; and how to easily connect different computational steps in Galaxy. Part 2 will focus on how to teach bioinformatics with Galaxy and to design bioinformatics courses using Galaxy. Participants can register for both parts separately.This course is also interspersed with a few keynotes, from recognised researchers in the fields of Biomedicine, Bioinformatics education and Galaxy workflows. The confirmed speakers include Jaap Heringa, who is the scientific director of the Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre; and Björn Grüning, who is the leader of Galaxy training network, also actively involved in Bioconda.\n\nFor more information and the application form, please see the <a href="https://www.biosb.nl/education/course-portfolio/bioinformatics-for-translational-medicine-using-galaxy/">course page</a>\n\n<h3 id="target-audience">TARGET AUDIENCE</h3><ol>  <li>Biomedical &amp; translational medicine researchers/students who are keen on bioinformatics</li>  <li>Educators in the “bio” domain who would like to start using Galaxy in their courses as an introduction to Bioinformatics.</li></ol><h3 id="prerequisite-knowledge">PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE</h3>The attendees of Part I are assumed to have the basic knowledge of biomedicine (molecular biology and genomics) and be interested in analysing patient derived sequencing data. The attendees of Part II are assumed to have some teaching experience in bioinformatics.\n\n<h3 id="course-schedule">COURSE SCHEDULE</h3>The course consists of six modules, as the table above shows, covering a list of topics as follows:\n\n<ul>  <li>Introduction to Galaxy.
