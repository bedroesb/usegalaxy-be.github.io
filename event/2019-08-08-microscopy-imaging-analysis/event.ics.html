DESCRIPTION:We would like to draw your attention to the upcoming course“Microscopy Image Analysis” organized by the Heidelberg Center for Human Bioinformatics (HD-HuB).\n\nThe course gives an introduction into the field of microscopy image analysis for cell biology and the use of software toolsfor automated processing of image data. Basic methods for computer-based analysis of microscopy images are introduced suchas image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, colocalization, and tracking.Concepts of software platforms with focus on ImageJ and their use for analyzing cell microscopy image dataare also taught. Workflow systems for automating image analysis pipelines are also considered (e.g., KNIME, Galaxy).The course consists of lectures and practical sessions. Participants should bring their laptops for the practical sessions.The target group are researchers with a background in biology or medicinethat need to analyze their data and have little or no experience in automated image analysis.\n\n<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>Basic knowledge in using software tools for image analysis is helpful but not mandatory\n\n<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning goals</h2><ul>  <li>Introduction into cell microscopy image analysis</li>  <li>Application of software tools for automated analysis of image data</li></ul><h2 id="keywords">Keywords</h2>Computer-based image analysis, image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, colocalization, tracking\n\n<h2 id="course-fee">Course fee</h2>Participants will be charged with a course fee of 40 Euros(to cover the lunch and infrastructure related cost). The invoice details will be shared via email.\n\n<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>Please register directly on the HD-HuB website: https://www.hd-hub.de/course-dates/3-all/47-microscopy-image-analysis-course\n\nIn the “Comments” section of the registration form, please provide some information about yourself andyour motivation to attend the training (e.g. Position, Field of study/Background, Topic of work, Knowledge of image analysis methods/tools).\n\nRegistration closes on August 11, 2019.\n\nThe capacity is limited to 20 participants and applicants will be selected after registration closed. You will be notified of the outcome by e-mail on August 23, 2019.\n\n
